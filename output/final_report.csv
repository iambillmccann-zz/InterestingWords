I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.

I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.

All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.

For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.

And it won't be easy.

Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.

I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.

That is why this campaign can't only be about me.

Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.

More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.

Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.

I just think he doesn't know.

It's not because John McCain doesn't care.

It's because John McCain doesn't get it.

Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.

I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.

Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.

And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.

And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.

If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.

Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.

But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.

John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.

That won't keep America safe.

You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.

For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.

Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.

Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.

If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.

When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty.

What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.

You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.

These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.

Because people just couldn't pronounce it.

That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.

I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.

She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.

Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.

That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.

I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.

Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.

I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.

I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.

I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.

We just didn't know he was talking about this one.

Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.

I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.

The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.

The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is.

The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.

It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair.

It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.

It doesn't work.

We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.

We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.

The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families.

The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford.

When asked what was wrong, she said, ""I don't want to take hairdressing.

I don't need to sew to go to college.

I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.

So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.

Doesn't he want to see this?""

As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.

It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.

I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.

But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.

All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.

We know the challenges.

And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.

Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.

Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.

I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.

It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.

I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.

And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well.

I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.

Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.

I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.

And you know what - it's worked before.

If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.

She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.

No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.

You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.

I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.

You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building.

We just didn't know he was talking about this one.

Americans know this.

We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.

But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.

We know that there are some things we do better together.

We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.

Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.

We know who we are.

And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.

Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.

We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.

And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.

I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.

And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.

And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.

We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.

And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.

In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.

I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.

As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.

I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.

I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.

We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.

As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.

American,48,doc1 doc2 doc3 doc4 doc5 doc6 ,"It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.

It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.

It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.

We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.

We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.

Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough!

This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.

We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.

It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.

It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.

It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.

Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it.

I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars.

And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.

Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.

Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.

Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time.

Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.

Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.

Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.

Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream.

That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.

And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.

If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.

Our time to write a new chapter in the American story.

My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.

Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.

In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?

A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq.

And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.

the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?

Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.

When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil.

300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.

The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.

And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers.

“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”
This is now the reality of Iraq.

This is now the reality of Iraq.

And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.

The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.

It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.

The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.

Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.

As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.

But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.

and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.

But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.

"
also,34,doc1 doc2 doc3 doc4 doc5 doc6 ,"But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.

And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.

It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.

That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.

But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.

And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.

But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.

But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression.

What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose.

But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.

But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.

That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.

The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.

Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.

Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.

And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.

What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.

Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.

And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.

Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.

But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.

Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.

Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.

But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.

We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.

But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?

The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.

Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.

Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.

For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.

I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.

We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.

""Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.

That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.

But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.

That's not the judgment we need.

We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.

If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.

As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home.

The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past.

You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.

I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.

I did not need sewing either.

I don't need to sew to go to college.

Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must.

We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.

We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.

But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.

We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?

And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.

And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.

And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?

We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.

My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.

We need to see more.

We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.

But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.

We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.

Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.

That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways.

I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the ""Pipeline"" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.

In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.

His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.

In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.

Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.

As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.

Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.

Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.

The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.

But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.

And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.

This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.

In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.

and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.

We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.

Corruption is not a new problem.

Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.

And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.

What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.

And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.

And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education.

Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American.

And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.

I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.

In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope.

In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.

It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.

I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.

All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.

Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.

I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.

These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.

Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.

The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.

And they want to believe again.

We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say ""yes"" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.

I believe there a number of factors at work.

As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.

I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.

And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.

There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.

And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.

Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.

And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.

And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.

Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.

“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”

It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.

And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.

The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.

By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.

We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.

This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.

Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.

So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity.

And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.

And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.

According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should ""mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.

And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.

For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?

Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.

But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.

And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.

We know that there are some things we do better together.

We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.

Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.

An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.

Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America.

I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.

And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote.

It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now.

It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.

I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.

We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.

According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should ""mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.

This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.

Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator.

Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes.

And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.

Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.

last,20,doc1 doc2 doc3 doc4 doc5 doc6 ,"For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.

Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.

To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.

America, we are better than these last eight years.

And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.

Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.

Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.

And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.

And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.

He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?

In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.

The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.

By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives.

Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.

Thousands more have suffered wounds that will last a lifetime.

We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes.

Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.

300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.

Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.

More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.

Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.

Not even close.

John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives.

And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.

Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.

That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.

Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old.

To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.

It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.

Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq.

But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.

standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.

We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?

This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.

With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?

As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.

He said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this President.

The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.

She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.

You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago.

To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.

The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.

And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.

A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.

And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.

By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future.

progress,19,doc1 doc2 doc3 doc4 doc5 doc6 ,"We've made some progress already.

He said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this President.

You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.

We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.

We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.

She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.

His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.

But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.

The good news is that there are already signs of progress here.

We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.

It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.

The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.

But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.

As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.

Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.

The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.

Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front.

While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.

It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.

They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.

They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint.

Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.

I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise.

I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.

And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?

And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.

In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.

And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.

It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.

I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.

It is time to give Iraqis their country back.

I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.
