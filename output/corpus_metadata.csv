1,We all made this journey for a reason.,doc1.txt,1

3,"In the face of war, you believe there can be peace.",doc1.txt,3
4,"In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope.",doc1.txt,4
5,"In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.",doc1.txt,5
6,That's the journey we're on today.,doc1.txt,6
7,But let me tell you how I came to be here.,doc1.txt,7
8,"As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.",doc1.txt,8
9,I moved to Illinois over two decades ago.,doc1.txt,9
10,"I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.",doc1.txt,10
11,"But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.",doc1.txt,11
12,"And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America.",doc1.txt,12
13,My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.,doc1.txt,13
14,I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.,doc1.txt,14
15,"I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.",doc1.txt,15
16,"It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.",doc1.txt,16
17,"After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need.",doc1.txt,17
18,"I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate.",doc1.txt,18
19,It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.,doc1.txt,19
20,"It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.",doc1.txt,20
21,I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today.,doc1.txt,21
22,"It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.",doc1.txt,22
23,That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken.,doc1.txt,23
24,That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.,doc1.txt,24
25,"That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.",doc1.txt,25
26,"It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.",doc1.txt,26
27,"And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States.",doc1.txt,27
28,I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement.,doc1.txt,28
29,I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.,doc1.txt,29
30,But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.,doc1.txt,30
31,The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.,doc1.txt,31
32,"And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before.",doc1.txt,32
33,"In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees.",doc1.txt,33
34,"In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free.",doc1.txt,34
35,"In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty.",doc1.txt,35
36,"We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.",doc1.txt,36
37,"Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.",doc1.txt,37
38,Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.,doc1.txt,38
39,"For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it.",doc1.txt,39
40,That's what Abraham Lincoln understood.,doc1.txt,40
41,He had his doubts.,doc1.txt,41
42,He had his defeats.,doc1.txt,42
43,He had his setbacks.,doc1.txt,43
44,"But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people.",doc1.txt,44
45,"It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.",doc1.txt,45
46,"It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.",doc1.txt,46
47,"All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.",doc1.txt,47
48,We know the challenges.,doc1.txt,48
49,We've heard them.,doc1.txt,49
50,We've talked about them for years.,doc1.txt,50
51,What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.,doc1.txt,51
52,"What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems.",doc1.txt,52
53,"For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.",doc1.txt,53
54,"And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.",doc1.txt,54
55,"We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants.",doc1.txt,55
56,"And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.",doc1.txt,56
57,"The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play.",doc1.txt,57
58,"They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.",doc1.txt,58
59,The time for that politics is over.,doc1.txt,59
60,It's time to turn the page.,doc1.txt,60
61,We've made some progress already.,doc1.txt,61
62,I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.,doc1.txt,62
63,But Washington has a long way to go.,doc1.txt,63
64,And it won't be easy.,doc1.txt,64
65,That's why we'll have to set priorities.,doc1.txt,65
66,We'll have to make hard choices.,doc1.txt,66
67,"And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.",doc1.txt,67
68,"Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.",doc1.txt,68
69,So let us begin.,doc1.txt,69
70,Let us begin this hard work together.,doc1.txt,70

75,"Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America.",doc1.txt,75
76,"And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.",doc1.txt,76
77,Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.,doc1.txt,77
78,Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement.,doc1.txt,78
79,And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again.,doc1.txt,79
80,Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America.,doc1.txt,80
81,"Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.",doc1.txt,81
82,Let's do this.,doc1.txt,82
83,Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis.,doc1.txt,83
84,"We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy.",doc1.txt,84
85,"Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.",doc1.txt,85
86,Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil.,doc1.txt,86
87,"We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.",doc1.txt,87
88,We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases.,doc1.txt,88
89,"We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world.",doc1.txt,89
90,Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.,doc1.txt,90
91,"Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.",doc1.txt,91
92,Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.,doc1.txt,92
93,"I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons.",doc1.txt,93
94,"We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities.",doc1.txt,94
95,But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe.,doc1.txt,95
96,But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.,doc1.txt,96
97,Most of you know I opposed this war from the start.,doc1.txt,97
98,I thought it was a tragic mistake.,doc1.txt,98
99,"Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.",doc1.txt,99
100,"America, it's time to start bringing our troops home.",doc1.txt,100
101,It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war.,doc1.txt,101
102,That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.,doc1.txt,102
103,"Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.",doc1.txt,103
104,"Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.",doc1.txt,104
105,Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love.,doc1.txt,105
106,Let us be the generation that begins this work.,doc1.txt,106
107,I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.,doc1.txt,107
108,I understand the skepticism.,doc1.txt,108
109,"After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.",doc1.txt,109
110,All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country.,doc1.txt,110
111,"But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.",doc1.txt,111
112,That is why this campaign can't only be about me.,doc1.txt,112
113,It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together.,doc1.txt,113
114,"This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams.",doc1.txt,114
115,"It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.",doc1.txt,115
116,"This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.",doc1.txt,116
117,"By ourselves, this change will not happen.",doc1.txt,117
118,"Divided, we are bound to fail.",doc1.txt,118
119,"But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible.",doc1.txt,119
120,He tells us that there is power in words.,doc1.txt,120
121,He tells us that there is power in conviction.,doc1.txt,121
122,"That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.",doc1.txt,122
123,He tells us that there is power in hope.,doc1.txt,123
124,"As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: ""Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through.""",doc1.txt,124
125,That is our purpose here today.,doc1.txt,125

127,"Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.",doc1.txt,127

130,"I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America.",doc1.txt,130
131,"And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you.",doc1.txt,131
132,"Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.",doc1.txt,132

With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.",doc2.txt,0
134,"Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton.",doc2.txt,1
135,"To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you.",doc2.txt,2

137,"To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you.",doc2.txt,4
138,"Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.",doc2.txt,5
139,"It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.",doc2.txt,6
140,That's why I stand here tonight.,doc2.txt,7
141,"Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.",doc2.txt,8
142,"We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.",doc2.txt,9

146,These challenges are not all of government's making.,doc2.txt,13
147,But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W. Bush.,doc2.txt,14
148,"America, we are better than these last eight years.",doc2.txt,15
149,We are a better country than this.,doc2.txt,16
150,"This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work.",doc2.txt,17
151,"This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.",doc2.txt,18
152,We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.,doc2.txt,19

154,"This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.",doc2.txt,21
155,"Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third.",doc2.txt,22
156,And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.,doc2.txt,23
157,"On November 4th, we must stand up and say: ""Eight is enough.""",doc2.txt,24
158,Now let there be no doubt.,doc2.txt,25
159,"The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.",doc2.txt,26
160,"And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need.",doc2.txt,27
161,But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.,doc2.txt,28
162,"Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?",doc2.txt,29
163,"I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.",doc2.txt,30
164,"The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.",doc2.txt,31
165,"He said that our economy has made ""great progress"" under this President.",doc2.txt,32
166,He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.,doc2.txt,33
167,"And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a ""mental recession,"" and that we've become, and I quote, ""a nation of whiners.""",doc2.txt,34
168,A nation of whiners?,doc2.txt,35
169,"Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.",doc2.txt,36
170,Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty.,doc2.txt,37
171,These are not whiners.,doc2.txt,38
172,They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint.,doc2.txt,39
173,These are the Americans that I know.,doc2.txt,40
174,"Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.",doc2.txt,41
175,I just think he doesn't know.,doc2.txt,42
176,Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year?,doc2.txt,43
177,How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?,doc2.txt,44
178,"How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?",doc2.txt,45
179,It's not because John McCain doesn't care.,doc2.txt,46
180,It's because John McCain doesn't get it.,doc2.txt,47
181,"For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.",doc2.txt,48

188,Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.,doc2.txt,55
189,You're on your own.,doc2.txt,56
190,Well it's time for them to own their failure.,doc2.txt,57
191,It's time for us to change America.,doc2.txt,58
192,"You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.",doc2.txt,59
193,We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.,doc2.txt,60
194,"We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.",doc2.txt,61
195,"We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.",doc2.txt,62
196,The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.,doc2.txt,63

198,"In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.",doc2.txt,65

201,She's the one who taught me about hard work.,doc2.txt,68

227,"In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels.",doc2.txt,94
228,"And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office.",doc2.txt,95
229,"Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.",doc2.txt,96

251,"But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.",doc2.txt,118
252,"And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.",doc2.txt,119

255,"Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.",doc2.txt,122
256,But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.,doc2.txt,123
257,Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise.,doc2.txt,124

263,"And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.",doc2.txt,130
264,That's not the judgment we need.,doc2.txt,131

282,These are the policies I will pursue.,doc2.txt,149
283,"And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain.",doc2.txt,150
284,But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.,doc2.txt,151
285,Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.,doc2.txt,152
286,"The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.",doc2.txt,153

303,I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.,doc2.txt,170
304,"They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.",doc2.txt,171

308,You make a big election about small things.,doc2.txt,175

338,That promise is our greatest inheritance.,doc2.txt,205

376,"You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?""",doc3.txt,17
377,And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today.,doc3.txt,18
378,"That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.",doc3.txt,19

398,And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.,doc3.txt,39
399,And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it.,doc3.txt,40
400,She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed.,doc3.txt,41
401,"She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.",doc3.txt,42

528,But it was a magical trip.,doc4.txt,8
529,"To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty.",doc4.txt,9
530,"I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left.",doc4.txt,10
531,"And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.",doc4.txt,11
532,"I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called ""boy"" by his employers for most of his life.",doc4.txt,12

534,"I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.",doc4.txt,14
535,I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.,doc4.txt,15
536,"In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.",doc4.txt,16
537,"And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.",doc4.txt,17
538,"His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.",doc4.txt,18
539,"And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.",doc4.txt,19
540,"In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.",doc4.txt,20
541,"The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.",doc4.txt,21
542,"But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.",doc4.txt,22
543,One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise.,doc4.txt,23
544,"In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea.",doc4.txt,24
545,"Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's.",doc4.txt,25
546,How can we explain this fact?,doc4.txt,26
547,"Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.",doc4.txt,27
548,"We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country.",doc4.txt,28
549,And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches.,doc4.txt,29
550,So what explains this?,doc4.txt,30
551,I believe there a number of factors at work.,doc4.txt,31
552,"Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.",doc4.txt,32
553,"It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.",doc4.txt,33
554,"Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.",doc4.txt,34
555,"This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.",doc4.txt,35
556,"Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade.",doc4.txt,36
557,"When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.",doc4.txt,37
558,"And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: ""Power concedes nothing without a demand.",doc4.txt,38
559,"It never did, and it never will.""",doc4.txt,39
560,"As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.",doc4.txt,40
561,This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth.,doc4.txt,41
562,"Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.",doc4.txt,42
563,"As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.",doc4.txt,43
564,"And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.",doc4.txt,44
565,A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent.,doc4.txt,45
566,"But, Kenya must do its part.",doc4.txt,46
567,It cannot wait for other nations to act first.,doc4.txt,47
568,"The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.",doc4.txt,48
569,It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.,doc4.txt,49
570,"Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.",doc4.txt,50
571,One that serves its people and is free from corruption.,doc4.txt,51
572,There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring.,doc4.txt,52

575,"And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy.",doc4.txt,55
576,It is being threatened by corruption.,doc4.txt,56
577,Corruption is not a new problem.,doc4.txt,57
578,"It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem.",doc4.txt,58
579,"It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society.",doc4.txt,59
580,"My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.",doc4.txt,60
581,"In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.",doc4.txt,61
582,"But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.",doc4.txt,62
583,"I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.",doc4.txt,63
584,And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this.,doc4.txt,64
585,"It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health.",doc4.txt,65
586,It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.,doc4.txt,66
587,"In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else.",doc4.txt,67
588,"And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.",doc4.txt,68
589,Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate.,doc4.txt,69
590,It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought.,doc4.txt,70
591,What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions.,doc4.txt,71
592,"It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice.",doc4.txt,72
593,"Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.",doc4.txt,73
594,"Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism.",doc4.txt,74
595,"Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust.",doc4.txt,75
596,"In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.",doc4.txt,76
597,And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time.,doc4.txt,77
598,The good news is that there are already signs of progress here.,doc4.txt,78
599,Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya.,doc4.txt,79
600,"The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.",doc4.txt,80
601,"Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002.",doc4.txt,81
602,"This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.",doc4.txt,82
603,But elections are not enough.,doc4.txt,83
604,"In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people.",doc4.txt,84
605,"Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.",doc4.txt,85
606,"The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.",doc4.txt,86
607,And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.,doc4.txt,87
608,"I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.",doc4.txt,88
609,We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.,doc4.txt,89
610,"And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.",doc4.txt,90
611,So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.,doc4.txt,91
612,"Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.",doc4.txt,92
613,"And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.",doc4.txt,93
614,Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.,doc4.txt,94
615,"In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.",doc4.txt,95
616,"Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.",doc4.txt,96
617,"Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop.",doc4.txt,97
618,"It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good.",doc4.txt,98
619,It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society.,doc4.txt,99
620,"Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing.",doc4.txt,100
621,"Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor.",doc4.txt,101
622,"An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle.",doc4.txt,102

708,The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.,doc5.txt,61
709,They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.,doc5.txt,62

713,and that strategy must change.,doc5.txt,66

715,Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?,doc5.txt,68
716,dreams and hopes.,doc5.txt,69
717,We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ?,doc5.txt,70
718,"namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.",doc5.txt,71
719,There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.,doc5.txt,72
720,"And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.",doc5.txt,73
721,"It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.",doc5.txt,74
722,"Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.",doc5.txt,75
723,Let me underscore this point.,doc5.txt,76
724,"The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.",doc5.txt,77
725,They are doing so today.,doc5.txt,78
726,"They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq.",doc5.txt,79
727,"But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.",doc5.txt,80
728,"Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.",doc5.txt,81
729,"And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.",doc5.txt,82
730,I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one.,doc5.txt,83
731,"To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.",doc5.txt,84
732,"No more coddling, no more equivocation.",doc5.txt,85
733,Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ?,doc5.txt,86
734,"military, financial, diplomatic ?",doc5.txt,87
735,to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.,doc5.txt,88
736,The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?,doc5.txt,89
737,a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.,doc5.txt,90
738,"When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.",doc5.txt,91
739,"Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must.",doc5.txt,92
740,For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?,doc5.txt,93
741,that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.,doc5.txt,94
742,Let me be more specific.,doc5.txt,95
743,The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U.S. forces.,doc5.txt,96
744,He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates.,doc5.txt,97
745,"When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?",doc5.txt,98
746,but it should not depend on Iraqi approval.,doc5.txt,99
747,I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid.,doc5.txt,100
748,"We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.",doc5.txt,101
749,The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.,doc5.txt,102
750,"Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.",doc5.txt,103
751,Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.,doc5.txt,104
752,"This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.",doc5.txt,105
753,"Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.",doc5.txt,106
754,"The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.",doc5.txt,107
755,"Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.",doc5.txt,108
756,"By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.",doc5.txt,109
757,"As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.",doc5.txt,110
758,"In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced U.S. force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time.",doc5.txt,111
759,But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?,doc5.txt,112
760,in a public and unambiguous way ?,doc5.txt,113
761,for such continued support.,doc5.txt,114
762,"We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.",doc5.txt,115
763,Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region.,doc5.txt,116
764,"The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?",doc5.txt,117
765,especially special forces ?,doc5.txt,118
766,who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers.,doc5.txt,119
767,An increase in the quality and quantity of U.S. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.,doc5.txt,120
768,Let me emphasize one vital point ?,doc5.txt,121
769,any U.S. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq.,doc5.txt,122
770,"In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U.S. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.",doc5.txt,123
771,"Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.",doc5.txt,124
772,"We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.",doc5.txt,125
773,The security forces have to be far more inclusive ?,doc5.txt,126
774,standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder.,doc5.txt,127
775,The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.,doc5.txt,128
776,"So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.",doc5.txt,129
777,"But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.",doc5.txt,130
778,"Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.",doc5.txt,131
779,"This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.",doc5.txt,132
780,This means no more bloated no-bid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses.,doc5.txt,133
781,We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.,doc5.txt,134
782,But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.,doc5.txt,135
783,"Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.",doc5.txt,136
784,"This includes opening dialogue with both Syria and Iran, an idea supported by both James Baker and Robert Gates.",doc5.txt,137
785,"We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions.",doc5.txt,138
786,"But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?",doc5.txt,139
787,and within their own countries.,doc5.txt,140
788,"And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others.",doc5.txt,141
789,"The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.",doc5.txt,142
790,Make no mistake ?,doc5.txt,143
791,"if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.",doc5.txt,144
792,It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening.,doc5.txt,145
793,"We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.",doc5.txt,146
794,It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.,doc5.txt,147
795,This brings me to a set of broader points.,doc5.txt,148
796,"As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.",doc5.txt,149
797,Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.,doc5.txt,150
798,But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?,doc5.txt,151
799,that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.,doc5.txt,152
800,"And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.",doc5.txt,153
801,The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.,doc5.txt,154
802,"In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.",doc5.txt,155
803,"This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal.",doc5.txt,156
804,"But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?",doc5.txt,157
805,"free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ?",doc5.txt,158
806,"cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.",doc5.txt,159
807,And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ?,doc5.txt,160
808,especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ?,doc5.txt,161
809,do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.,doc5.txt,162
810,"The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.",doc5.txt,163
811,Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.,doc5.txt,164
812,Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable.,doc5.txt,165
813,"If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.",doc5.txt,166
814,"The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ?",doc5.txt,167
815,"and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.",doc5.txt,168
816,We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist.,doc5.txt,169
817,"But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.",doc5.txt,170
818,"This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies.",doc5.txt,171
819,We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?,doc5.txt,172
820,threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.,doc5.txt,173
821,"The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.",doc5.txt,174
822,But there are many others.,doc5.txt,175
823,"The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.",doc5.txt,176
824,"The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.",doc5.txt,177
825,"In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.",doc5.txt,178
826,"And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.",doc5.txt,179
827,There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?,doc5.txt,180
828,and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people.,doc5.txt,181
829,"According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should ""mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.",doc5.txt,182
830,"9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us.",doc5.txt,183
831,"And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world.",doc5.txt,184
832,"But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?",doc5.txt,185
833,a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.,doc5.txt,186
834,Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago.,doc5.txt,187
835,It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust.,doc5.txt,188
836,I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.,doc5.txt,189
837,I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.,doc5.txt,190
838,There have been too many speeches.,doc5.txt,191
839,There have been too many excuses.,doc5.txt,192
840,"There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.",doc5.txt,193
841,The time for waiting in Iraq is over.,doc5.txt,194
842,It is time to change our policy.,doc5.txt,195
843,It is time to give Iraqis their country back.,doc5.txt,196
844,And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.,doc5.txt,197
845,Thank you.,doc5.txt,198
846, Good morning.,doc6.txt,0
847,"As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.",doc6.txt,1
848,"Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.",doc6.txt,2
849,"We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev.",doc6.txt,3
850,"This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program.",doc6.txt,4
851,"We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.",doc6.txt,5
852,Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator.,doc6.txt,6
853,"Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes.",doc6.txt,7
854,"She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.",doc6.txt,8
855,"Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax.",doc6.txt,9
856,"Others, the plague.",doc6.txt,10
857,"At this point I turned around and said ""Hey, where's Lugar?",doc6.txt,11
858,"Doesn't he want to see this?""",doc6.txt,12
859,"I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room.",doc6.txt,13
860,"He looked at me and said, ""Been there, done that.""",doc6.txt,14
861,"Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.",doc6.txt,15
862,But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.,doc6.txt,16
863,"Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.",doc6.txt,17
864,"And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.",doc6.txt,18
865,We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.,doc6.txt,19
866,Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.,doc6.txt,20
867,"Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding.",doc6.txt,21
868,"And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.",doc6.txt,22
869,"Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.",doc6.txt,23
870,"And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?",doc6.txt,24
871,"With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?",doc6.txt,25
872,"The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community.",doc6.txt,26
873,"Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.",doc6.txt,27
874,"For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.",doc6.txt,28
875,"First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.",doc6.txt,29
876,"The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.",doc6.txt,30
877,"Yet, a serious threat still remains.",doc6.txt,31
878,"Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.",doc6.txt,32
879,"For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.",doc6.txt,33
880,Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.,doc6.txt,34
881,"In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.",doc6.txt,35
882,"In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.",doc6.txt,36
883,I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.,doc6.txt,37
884,"Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.",doc6.txt,38
885,"At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few.",doc6.txt,39
886,"As one book says, ""disease by the ton was its industry.""",doc6.txt,40
887,"Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.",doc6.txt,41
888,"While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.",doc6.txt,42
889,"Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.",doc6.txt,43
890,Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.,doc6.txt,44
891,This was two letters.,doc6.txt,45
892,"Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front.",doc6.txt,46
893,"For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.",doc6.txt,47
894,"And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.",doc6.txt,48
895,"But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.",doc6.txt,49
896,We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.,doc6.txt,50
897,One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.,doc6.txt,51
898,"Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.",doc6.txt,52
899,"As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.",doc6.txt,53
900,"My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.",doc6.txt,54
901,"On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.",doc6.txt,55
902,"In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled.",doc6.txt,56
903,"While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.",doc6.txt,57
904,"But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan.",doc6.txt,58
905,"By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference.",doc6.txt,59
906,One final point.,doc6.txt,60
907,"For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow.",doc6.txt,61
908,"Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.",doc6.txt,62
909,Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces.,doc6.txt,63
910,"Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.",doc6.txt,64
911,"But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.",doc6.txt,65
912,"We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.",doc6.txt,66
913,.,doc6.txt,67
914,One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.,doc6.txt,68
915,This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.,doc6.txt,69
916,Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.,doc6.txt,70
917,"Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians.",doc6.txt,71
918,I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.,doc6.txt,72
919,"But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.",doc6.txt,73
920,It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.,doc6.txt,74
921,"And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.",doc6.txt,75
922,"It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.",doc6.txt,76
923,But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.,doc6.txt,77
924,We need to see more.,doc6.txt,78
925,"We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.",doc6.txt,79
926,And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.,doc6.txt,80
927,There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead.,doc6.txt,81
928,It will be difficult.,doc6.txt,82
929,And it will be dangerous.,doc6.txt,83
930,"But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union.",doc6.txt,84
931,"""Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.",doc6.txt,85
932,We all breathe the same air.,doc6.txt,86
933,We all cherish our children's future.,doc6.txt,87
934,And we are all mortal.'',doc6.txt,88
935,Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right.,doc6.txt,89
936,Thank you.,doc6.txt,90
